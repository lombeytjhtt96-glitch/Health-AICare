# Insights Agent

## IA - Insights Agent

## What Is the IA?

The Insights Agent (IA) serves as the system's analytics layer. While other agents manage individual student interactions, the IA operates at a population level. It addresses broader inquiries, such as the proportion of students exhibiting stress indicators or identifying departments with increased anxiety-related conversations. Population-level mental health analytics provide significant value beyond direct student support. Aggregated and anonymized trend data enables counseling services to allocate resources more effectively, identify at-risk cohorts early, and assess intervention success.

The IA exists because the value of a mental health support platform is not limited to the students it helps directly. Aggregated, anonymised trend data helps counselling services allocate resources, identify at-risk cohorts early, and evaluate the effectiveness of their interventions.

## The Privacy Challenge

Population-level mental health analytics present a privacy challenge due to the sensitivity of the data. Even aggregated statistics can potentially reveal individual information if group sizes are small. The IA mitigates this risk using two primary mechanisms. First, k-anonymity ensures that every analytics query enforces a minimum group size. If a query result involves fewer than k individuals (where k defaults to 5), the result is suppressed or generalized. This prevents the reverse-engineering of individual identities from small-group data. Second, differential privacy adds calibrated statistical noise to aggregate statistics, such as means and percentages, before returning results. The magnitude of this noise is controlled by a privacy budget parameter. These combined mechanisms ensure that individual mental health status cannot be inferred from IA outputs, providing strong privacy guarantees even against informed adversaries.

The IA addresses this with two complementary privacy mechanisms:

### k-Anonymity

Every analytics query enforces a minimum group size. If a query would return a result representing fewer than **k individuals** (default k = 5), the result is suppressed or generalised. For example:

- *"How many Computer Science students reported depression indicators this week?"* → If the answer is 3, the IA returns `< 5` rather than the precise count.
- This prevents an administrator from reverse-engineering individual students from small-group queries.

### Differential Privacy

For aggregate statistics (means, percentages, score distributions), the IA adds calibrated statistical noise before returning results. The noise magnitude is tuned via a privacy budget parameter (epsilon, ε). Smaller ε = more noise = stronger privacy guarantee, at the cost of slightly less precise statistics.

These two mechanisms together mean the IA can honestly say: **no individual student's mental health status can be inferred from its outputs**, even by an adversary with knowledge of the general population.

## What the IA Can Answer

The IA is invoked when an administrator or counsellor asks a question through HealthAI that requires population-level data. Representative queries:

| Query Type | Example | Data Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Trend analysis** | "How has the average risk score changed over the past 4 weeks?" | `ConversationRiskAssessment` aggregates |
| **Cohort comparison** | "Which faculties show the highest proportion of high-risk conversations?" | Cross-join with user faculty field |
| **Screening distributions** | "What is the distribution of PHQ-9 indicators across active students?" | `ScreeningProfile` table, k-anonymised |
| **Intervention effectiveness** | "Do students who completed a TCA plan show lower risk scores in subsequent conversations?" | Longitudinal join across `UserInterventionPlan` and `ConversationRiskAssessment` |
| **Counsellor workload** | "How many open cases does each counsellor currently have?" | `CaseManagement` table (not anonymised - counsellor data is not sensitive in this context) |

## How the IA Works Inside LangGraph

The IA node is reached when HealthAI's intent classifier routes a message to `analytics`. The node:

1. Parses the natural language query to identify the required metric, time range, and cohort filter
2. Translates this to a parameterised SQL query (never raw user input - all parameters are sanitised)
3. Applies k-anonymity enforcement and differential privacy noise
4. Formats the result as a natural language summary plus a structured JSON object (which the frontend renders as a chart)

## Dashboard Integration

The IA feeds data to the **counsellor and administrator dashboard**, which visualises:

- **Population risk heatmap** - risk level distribution by faculty and week
- **Screening trend lines** - PHQ-9, GAD-7, DASS-21 community scores over time
- **Intervention funnel** - how many conversations → STA flags → TCA plans → CMA cases → resolved cases
- **Counsellor performance metrics** - average time to case acceptance, SLA compliance rates

All charts are rendered client-side in the Next.js dashboard. The IA provides the data; the frontend handles visualisation.

## Access Control

IA queries are only available to users with `counsellor` or `admin` roles. This is enforced at two layers:

1. **HealthAI's tool allowlist**: The `counsellor` and `admin` role allowlists include analytics-capable tools; the `user` role does not.
2. **API endpoint RBAC**: The backend endpoints that serve IA data explicitly check the caller's role before processing.

A student cannot ask HealthAI for population-level data and receive a meaningful response - even indirectly.
